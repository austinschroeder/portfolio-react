            <p>Iâ€™m a software developer.  In a previous career, I worked with live concert touring and events.  Building a family has helped me realize the sacrifices involved with heavy traveling and touring.  Team building, coordinating logistics, and creating efficiency are things that are very important to me.  I seek a role as a software developer at a company where I can grow, and continue to master the craft.</p>
